<h1>Maya Majumdar</h1>
<p> I can work well with others and communicate with them, so they also show their ideas and not be afraid to. In high school I took a CIS class (Computer Information Systems) which taught each student how to use different type of programs like Excel or Adobe Photoshop and taught use how to make websites, and though I have just started, I have picked up a lot of new ways to improve websites and how to make it more appealing to the viewer.I can understand a little bit of Hindi and Sanskrit. I have attended La Petite Academy of San Diego then Deer Canyon Elementary then onto Mesa Verde Middle then from there Westview High school. When I was in Deer Canyon I competed in a Robotics competition and though our programming was not the best compared to other schools, my teams idea for earthquake safety was so good, we went to the mayor's office and shook hands with him and gave our ideas on how San Diego would be safe with our idea. I wanted to do a sport, but I have a major knee injury that's unknown at the moment, so I joined Westview Theatre Company because I wanted to be an actress or just be working in that field. I was apart of the set crew that build the set for “And Then There Were None” which one 3 CETA Main Stage awards for best set. Though I have done, so much with theatre, I would like to work on programing and making websites in the future. I am a Freshman and I am still figuring out what I want to major in, but I do have a deep interest in business and marketing so I would like to get further in that subject. </p>
